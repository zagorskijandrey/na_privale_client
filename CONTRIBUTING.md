## New Contributors

Thank you for your interest in helping make this repository better!

Please bear in mind [the goal](/README.md#goal) of this repository when considering your contributions. I try to keep an up to date [backlog of issues](../../issues). I welcome pull requests that resolve any of those issues, but please check first to see if the issue has already been assigned or if anyone has indicated that they are working on it. If you are unsure of the status, don't hesitate to ask in a comment.

If you discover a bug or would like to see an enhancement that is not in that list, please [add a new issue](../../issues/new) to start a discussion before creating a pull request. I welcome your input!

## Collaborator Guidelines

First, thank you for helping maintain this repository!

In addition to the above guidelines, please open a pull request for all changes rather than directly pushing your commits to matser.

I will manage all releases and deployments myself after the code has been merged to master.

## Thank You

Thanks again for offering your valuable time to help make this repository more useful.
