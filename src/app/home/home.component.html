  <p>This is an example of how to use the <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/" target="_blank">ArcGIS API for JavaScript</a>
    in an application generated with the <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a>.</p>
  <p>One of the key benefits of the approach demonstrated in this application is that you can lazy load the map.
    Notice how fast this page loaded? That's because we haven't loaded the map yet. Click the button below to load and view the map.</p>
  <button md-raised-button routerLink="/map" routerLinkActive="active" color="primary" class="home-button-view-map">View Map</button>
